# Parsing library

It's connects to [Tululu](https://tululu.org/) library, fetch books and their cover and save it.

## How to install


Python3 should already be installed. Use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To download books use:

Example for command line:
```
$ python '\parsing_library> python3 main.py start_id end_id
```

Where `start_id` - book ID on [Tululu](https://tululu.org/) library from which the download will start.

`end_id` - book ID on [Tululu](https://tululu.org/) library where the download ends.
